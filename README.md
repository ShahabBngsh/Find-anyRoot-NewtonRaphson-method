# Approximate any Root using NewtonRaphson method
Root approximation using NewtonRaphson method which is faster than bisection method.
It is also generic, you can find any root not just squareroot.
For comparison finding sqrt(25) with bisection method will take around 23 iterations
while with NewtonRaphson method it'll only take 6 iterations.
